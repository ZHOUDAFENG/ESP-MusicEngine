# Examples

These examples are made to demonstrate the MusicEngine library for ESP8266 within the Arduino IDE.<br>
The examples were tested in the Arduino 1.6.10 IDE using an ESP-07 on a white breakout board with the buzzer connected to GPIO14 and the onboard LED on GPIO2.

**WARNING**: connecting a buzzer directly to an output-pin may draw too much current and can damage your ESP module. If you don't mind risking damage, go ahead; otherwise use a current limiting resistor or drive the buzzer via a transistor.

For more information see the comments in the example code or read the library documentation.
