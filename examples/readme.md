# Examples

These examples are made to demonstrate the MusicEngine library for ESP8266 within the Arduino IDE.<br>
The examples were tested in the Arduino 1.6.10 IDE using an ESP-07 on a white breakout board with the buzzer connected to GPIO14 and the onboard LED on GPIO2.

For more information see the comments in the example code or read the library documentation.
